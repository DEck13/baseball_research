My research on baseball.  


### Challenging_nostalgia

The Challenging_nostalgia directory contains a raw copy of my paper 
"Challenging nostalgia and performance metrics in baseball" which was recently 
published at CHANCE (see online-version.pdf).  This directory 
also includes a technical report that makes all of the calculations that were 
performed in the paper transparent.  This technical report is fully reproducible.

### Spray distributions

[with Charlie Young and David Dalpiaz] This directory contains a preliminary draft of a 
manuscript on spray chart distributions. Spray chart distributions are 2-dimensional 
distributions of the final batted ball locations in a scenario of interest. More to come.


### Paradoxical relationship of fWAR and wins

The WinsvfWAR directory contains analyses which show that in any given season, a team's 
total fangraphs wins above replacement (fWAR) is a great single predictor for a team's 
total wins. We also show that a significant number of franchises consistently 
underperform or overperform their fWAR. These two facts are in direct constrast of each 
other and it is surprising that they can hold simultaneously. Data credit goes to 
Fangraphs.


### Direct calculation of WAR

[with Sixian Li] The directWAR directory contains some exploratory analyses for a new 
simple approach to calculate a player's WAR that draws on ideas from causal inference. 
More to come.

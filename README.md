My research on baseball.  


### Challenging_nostalgia

The Challenging_nostalgia directory contains a raw copy of my paper 
"Challenging nostalgia and performance metrics in baseball" which was recently 
accepted for publication at CHANCE (see online-version.pdf).  This directory 
also includes a technical report that makes all of the calculations that were 
performed in the paper transparent.  This technical report is fully reproducible.
